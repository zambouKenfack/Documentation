        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Expense management is a key element of financial performance and effective business management. The expense management module integrated into the Movelys application allows organizations to track, control, and analyze in real-time all their operational financial outflows: purchases unrelated to products, service payments, operational expenses, or exceptional charges.
        </p>
        <p>
            This module provides a simple yet powerful interface to accurately record expenses by associating them with categories (e.g., transport, electricity, maintenance), suppliers, payment methods, supporting documents (attached files), and custom notes. Each expense is automatically linked to the fiscal year and can be integrated into financial reports for a comprehensive view of the company's economic health.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to its flexibility, Movelys also enables multi-location and multi-user tracking while ensuring complete traceability and secure centralization of information. This facilitates strategic decision-making, cost control, and the preparation of audits or management reports.

            <p>
                The "Expense" interface is designed to help businesses centralize, track, and <strong>analyze all outgoing payments related to their daily operations. It ensures effective budget management by providing complete visibility on:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Operational expenses,</li>
                <li>Completed or pending payments,</li>
                <li>One-time or recurring charges.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This page also offers powerful filtering, exporting, and <strong>accounting management</strong> tools.
