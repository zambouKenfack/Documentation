            <p>
                The Purchase and Sale report effectively compares company purchases against recorded sales to evaluate:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The gross profitability of operations,</li>
                <li>Discrepancies between amounts spent and recovered,</li>
                <li>Outstanding payments to suppliers (purchase due) or from customers (sale due),</li>
                <li>And detect operational imbalances.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

            <ul>
                <li>Tracking <strong>supplier and customer accounts,</strong></li>

        <h4>8.2.2) Popular Products Visualization</h4>
        <p>
            This section presents a graphical analysis of total sales in units for three fragrance references.
            The goal is to identify the top-performing products in terms of sales volume.
        </p>

        <h5>8.2.2.1) Chart Description</h5>
        <p>
            The chart used is a vertical bar diagram. It compares the total number of units sold for each product listed on the horizontal axis.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Y-axis (Ordinate):</strong><br>
            Represents numerical values of units sold.<br>
            Scale from 0 to 40.<br>
            Unit of measure: number of units.</li>
            <li><strong>X-axis (Abscissa):</strong><br>
            Displays the following three product references:<br>
             PERFUME – 00000100011 (fic)<br>
             AstraI24 – Luxury Women's Fragrance Essence 30%-50 ml -ASTRAL24(flc)<br>
             Women's Fragrance Essence 30%-100 ml-263(flc)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>8.2.2.2) Data Analysis</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best-Selling Product</strong><br>
            PERFUME – 00000100011 (fic) leads with approximately 33-34 units sold.<br>
            Clearly the top commercial performer among the three.</li>
            <li><strong>Moderate Sales Product</strong><br>
            AstraI24 – Luxury Women's Fragrance Essence 30%-50 ml -ASTRAL24(flc) records about 8 units sold.<br>
            Mid-range performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Lowest-Selling Product</strong><br>
            Women's Fragrance Essence 30%-100 ml-263(flc) recorded only about 1 unit sold.<br>
            Very weak commercial performance, requiring special attention.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The analysis highlights a strong disparity in sales volumes between the three products. PERFUME – 00000100011 (fic) dominates sales, while Women's Fragrance Essence 100 ml – 263 shows relative commercial failure.

        Movelys' report management module is much more than a simple analysis tool: it is a <strong>true decision-making dashboard integrated into the heart of your information system</strong>. It enables each manager – whether executive, accountant, logistician, or salesperson – to monitor the company's key indicators with precision and responsiveness.
