        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Contact management is an essential component of any effective business management system. In Movelys, this feature has been designed to enable accurate, structured, and centralized tracking of all the company's business relationships, whether they involve customers, suppliers, prospects, or partners.
        </p>
        <p>
            With an intuitive and flexible interface, users can record, view, and update complete contact records, including key information such as contact details, tax data, payment terms, outstanding balances, and transaction history. Movelys also allows categorizing contacts according to specific groups and automating certain actions, such as sending notifications or invoices.

            This structured management of contacts promotes better communication, faster decision-making, and improved customer/supplier relationships. It thus serves as a solid foundation for optimizing the commercial, accounting, and operational performance of the company.
