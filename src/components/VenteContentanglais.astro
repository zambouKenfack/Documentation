            <h3 id="function-objective">2.1) Function objective</h3>
            <p>The Add a sale section allows creating a new commercial transaction with a customer. It constitutes one of the most central functions of Movelys, as it records:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The sale content (products/services),</li>
                <li>Commercial terms (discounts, taxes, payments),</li>
                <li>Customer relations (new or existing),</li>
                <li>And operational impacts (inventory, invoices, reports, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="interface-presentation">2.2) Interface presentation</h3>
            <p>The interface consists of functional Sections which are:</p>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ The General sale information section:</h4>
            <p>It groups the key administrative elements of a transaction, those that define the <strong>sale framework which are:</strong></p>
            
            <h5>1. Customer</h5>
            <p>This field allows <strong>linking the sale to an existing customer in the database, or adding a new customer if necessary.</strong> This enables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking their purchase history,</li>
                <li>Generating personalized invoices,</li>
                <li>Managing specific commercial terms (discounts, deferred payment, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Without customer identification, it's impossible to manage credit, send personalized receipts, or retrieve the sale later.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Payment term (or payment deadline)</h5>
            <p>Optional field to define in <strong>how many days the payment should be made.</strong> Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0 days (cash payment),</li>
                <li>15 days (Net 15),</li>
                <li>30 days (Net 30),</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This activates credit management and helps the system track customer receivables and reminders.</p>
            
            <h5>3. Sale date</h5>
            <p>This is the date when the transaction is recorded (or supposed to occur). By default, Movelys suggests the current date, but it can be modified for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A retroactive order,</li>
                <li>An administrative postponement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This date is used in accounting, sales reports, and fiscal reports.</p>
            
            <h5>4. Billing scheme</h5>
            <p>Term used to designate the <strong>automatic or manual invoice numbering model.</strong> A billing scheme can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard (for example: INV-2025-001),</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Customized (by customer or sale type),</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It allows organizing invoices in a uniform and traceable manner.</p>
            
            <h5>5. Invoice number</h5>
            <p>Unique number identifying the sale (or draft) in the system. It can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatically generated by the system following the scheme,</strong></li>
                <li>Or manually entered by the user (if authorized).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This number is crucial for archiving, legal invoicing, and accounting tracking.</p>
            
            <h5>6. Attach a document</h5>
            <p>Option to add an attached file to the sale. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer purchase order,</li>
                <li>Advance payment proof,</li>
                <li>Specific commercial terms,</li>
                <li>External invoice or signed quote.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>3. Order tax rate (sometimes called 'Order Tax' or 'Order VAT')</h5>
            <p>This is the tax rate applied to the entire order. It is defined:</p>

            <h4>‚ùñ Payment details section</h4>
            <p>This section allows recording the <strong>exact financial terms related to a transaction.</strong> It is crucial to ensure <strong>accounting traceability, proper cash flow management, and</strong> the <strong>consistency of financial reports.</strong></p>
            
            <h5>1. Quantity</h5>

            <ul>
                <li>If the payment is linked to several sold items, the quantity corresponds to the number <strong>of invoiced items (often automatic from the products section).</strong></li>
                <li>In a <strong>staggered payment form, this field can indicate the number of</strong> <strong>partial payments recorded or allowed.</strong></li>
                <li>In a <strong>partial or multi-mode payment context, it can represent the</strong> <strong>quantity of</strong> <strong>products covered by a deposit.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Ensure the paid amount corresponds to one or several precise product quantities, or payment steps.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Payment method</h5>
            <p>The payment method defines how the customer settles the transaction. The most common options include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash:</strong> Payment in cash.</li>
                <li><strong>Bank transfer:</strong> Payment made by transfer from a bank account.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit card:</strong> Payment via electronic payment terminal (POS).</li>
                <li><strong>Check:</strong> Deferred payment by paper check.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer credit:</strong> Payment at a later due date (customer debtor account).</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile payment:</strong> Ex.: Orange Money, Moov Money, MTN Mobile Money...</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Allow the company to track financial flows by method, useful for accounting, cash register, audits, and refunds.</p>
            
            <h5>3. Payment note</h5>
            <p>The payment note is a free field intended to enter any additional information <strong>or justification related to the financial transaction.</strong> Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Deposit paid by transfer, balance expected within 7 days."</li>
                <li>"Payment by two different people."</li>
                <li>"Partial payment, discount pending."</li>
                <li>"Reduced amount following an exceptional commercial discount."</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Keep a written record to better explain certain payment operations, avoid disputes, and facilitate accounting verifications.</p>
            
            <h5>4. Payment date</h5>
            <p>This is the effective date when the payment was made or recorded in the system. Two scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If payment is immediate: this date is often equal to the sale or invoice date.</li>
                <li>If payment is deferred or staggered: this date is chosen manually and can be future or past (in case of regularization).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This date is used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sales or cash flow reports by period,</li>
                <li>Establishing payment schedules,</li>
                <li>Reminders in case of pending payment.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The POS (Point Of Sale) form in Movelys allows quick and complete entry of a <strong>physical in-store sale.</strong> It is designed to optimize the work of cashiers or sellers at a physical point of sale by providing an interface that is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intuitive and ergonomic,</strong></li>
                <li>Capable of handling complex transactions (discounts, deliveries, taxes),</li>
                <li>And directly integrated with inventory, customer, and cash register management.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The objective is to enable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Direct sale of in-stock products,</li>
                <li>Quick payment collection,</li>
                <li>Generation of customer receipts,</li>

            <h4>4.2.1. Transaction start</h4>
            <h5>A. Location selection</h5>
            <p>A menu at the top of the page displays the current location (e.g., <em>Senteur & Vitalit√©</em>), which is crucial in a multi-store environment. It indicates where the operation is recorded and affects <strong>inventory movements to this location.</strong></p>
            
            <h5>B. Sale date and time</h5>
            <p>Dynamic display of timestamp to:</p>
            <ul>

            <h4>4.2.2. Customer identification</h4>
            <p>The system defaults to an anonymous customer ("Walk-in customer"). A (+) button allows manually adding a new customer or selecting an existing one.</p>
            <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> if a customer is identified, the sale will be linked to their account for better tracking (purchase history, credit, loyalty).</p>
            
            <h4>4.2.3. Product addition</h4>
            <p>The interface offers several ways to add items to the cart:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>By entering the name, product code, or barcode scan,</li>
                <li>Or via direct selection from the visual catalog on the right.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each added product appears in an interactive table containing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Product name,</li>
                <li>Quantity to sell (modifiable),</li>
                <li>Unit price and subtotal,</li>
                <li>Delete icon.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Products are automatically decremented from stock upon sale validation.</p>

                <li>Editable via a pen icon.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>B. Order tax (Order Tax)</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Addition of tax (VAT or other) to the entire order.</li>
                <li>The system can be configured with different tax types depending on location.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>C. Delivery</h5>
            <ul>

            <h3 id="product-catalog">4.3) Product catalog (Right block)</h3>
            <p>The display by category and brand allows quick search. Each product displays:</p>

                <li>Unit price,</li>
                <li>Discount type,</li>

            <h3 id="draft-general-presentation">5.1) General presentation</h3>
            <p>The "Add a draft" functionality allows users to create a <strong>temporary unfinalized sale</strong>, stored in the system to be completed, validated, or modified later.</p>
            <p>This module is ideal for managing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Orders pending validation,</strong></li>
                <li>Sales <strong>partially paid or to be confirmed,</strong></li>
                <li>Or order preparations in a multi-step process.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="draft-objectives">5.2) Functionality objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow <strong>flexibility in managing incomplete sales.</strong></li>
                <li>Provide a temporary workspace before final confirmation.</li>
                <li>Help <strong>coordination between sales and accounting teams.</strong></li>
                <li>Reduce errors by taking time to <strong>verify information before finalization.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="draft-interface-presentation">5.3) Interface presentation</h3>
            <p>The form is identical to a classic sale, except that the <strong>default status is "Draft".</strong> It is divided into 4 sections</p>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ The General sale information section:</h4>
            <p>It groups the key administrative elements of a transaction, those that define the <strong>sale framework which are:</strong></p>
            
            <h5>1. Customer</h5>
            <p>This field allows <strong>linking the sale to an existing customer in the database, or adding a new customer if necessary.</strong> This enables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking their purchase history,</li>
                <li>Generating personalized invoices,</li>
                <li>Managing specific commercial terms (discounts, deferred payment, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Without customer identification, it's impossible to manage credit, send personalized receipts, or retrieve the sale later.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Payment term (or payment deadline)</h5>
            <p>Optional field to define in how many days the payment should be made. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0 days (cash payment),</li>
                <li>15 days (Net 15),</li>
                <li>30 days (Net 30),</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This activates credit management and helps the system track customer receivables and reminders.</p>
            
            <h5>3. Sale date</h5>
            <p>This is the date when the transaction is recorded (or supposed to occur). By default, Movelys suggests the current date, but it can be modified for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A retroactive order,</li>
                <li>An administrative postponement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This date is used in accounting, sales reports, and fiscal reports.</p>
            
            <h5>4. Billing scheme</h5>
            <p>Term used to designate the <strong>automatic or manual invoice numbering model.</strong> A billing scheme can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard (for example: INV-2025-001),</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Customized (by customer or sale type),</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It allows organizing invoices in a uniform and traceable manner.</p>
            
            <h5>5. Invoice number</h5>
            <p>Unique number identifying the sale (or draft) in the system. It can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatically generated by the system following the scheme,</strong></li>
                <li>Or manually entered by the user (if authorized).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This number is crucial for archiving, legal invoicing, and accounting tracking.</p>
            
            <h5>6. Attach a document</h5>
            <p>Option to add an attached file to the sale. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer purchase order,</li>
                <li>Advance payment proof,</li>
                <li>Specific commercial terms,</li>
                <li>External invoice or signed quote.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supported formats are typically: PDF, CSV, DOCX, PNG.</p>
            <p>Useful to justify a sale or attach any contractual document related to this transaction.</p>
            
            <h4>Summary: What is this section for?</h4>
            <p>The "General Information" section allows to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Precisely identify the sale and concerned customer,</li>
                <li>Define the legal and commercial framework of the transaction,</li>
                <li>Ensure data consistency across the entire Movelys system.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ Product addition section</h4>
            <p>In this section you can add a product and also search for a product already present in the database to add it to the table</p>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ Sale parameters section</h4>
            <p>It groups fields used to adjust pricing conditions, apply discounts, manage taxation, and insert internal or customer notes about the sale.</p>
            
            <h5>1. Discount type</h5>
            <p>This field defines how the discount is applied to the sale. The most common types are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Percentage (%): proportional reduction (e.g. 10%)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fixed amount: absolute value reduction (e.g. 5,000 FCFA)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It determines how the discount will be calculated on the total amount or on each item.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Discount amount</h5>
            <p>This field specifies the amount or percentage of discount to apply according to the chosen type. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the type is %, entering "10" will apply a 10% reduction on the order.</li>
                <li>If the type is amount, entering "2000" will deduct 2000 FCFA from the gross total.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Allows offering customer benefits or applying commercial policies (sales, promotions, commercial gestures).</p>
            
            <h5>3. Order tax rate (sometimes called 'Order Tax' or 'Order VAT')</h5>
            <p>This is the tax rate applied to the entire order. It is defined:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Either automatically according to the country or default configuration (e.g. 18%),</li>
                <li>Or selected manually (if multiple rates are possible depending on products or customers).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This rate is used for automatic VAT calculation or any regulatory tax, and will be included in the invoice.</p>
            
            <h5>4. Sale note</h5>
            <p>Free text field to add textual information to the sale. Usage examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Special instruction for delivery or billing,</li>
                <li>Specific commercial condition,</li>
                <li>Mention of a verbal agreement or customer commitment,</li>
                <li>Internal note for colleague follow-up.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This note may appear on the <strong>customer ticket, invoice, or remain internal depending on</strong> configuration.</p>
            
            <h4>Summary: Role of this section</h4>
            <p>The "Sale Parameters" section is essential to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customize pricing conditions,</li>
                <li>Comply with tax regulations,</li>
                <li>Facilitate internal or customer communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It gives the seller <strong>controlled negotiation flexibility while maintaining complete traceability.</strong></p>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ Shipping and logistics information section</h4>
            <p>It groups all elements necessary for order preparation, shipping, delivery, and <strong>physical tracking.</strong> It is activated as soon as a product needs to be physically delivered to the customer.</p>
            
            <h5>1. Shipping details</h5>

                <li>Indicate a tracking number,</li>
                <li>Mention a specificity (e.g.: express, grouped, by appointment...).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Serves as a visible summary for the seller or logistics.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Delivery address</h5>
            <p>Exact address where products should be delivered. It can be:</p>

                <li>Entered manually (temporary or different address).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This address is mandatory if delivery is planned. It is used for documents, labels, and zone calculations.</p>

            <h5>5. Delivered to</h5>
            <p>Name of the person receiving the order at the delivery address. This field is useful if the recipient is not the initial customer (e.g.: assistant, receptionist, third-party company).</p>

            <h5>Button: Add additional expenses</h5>
            <p>This button allows recording <strong>expenses associated with the order but not billed to the customer.</strong> Expense examples:</p>

            <h4>Role of this section</h4>
            <p>The logistics section enables <strong>complete management of the delivery chain, from address entry to post-delivery tracking.</strong> It is indispensable for any business performing <strong>physical deliveries, as it:</strong></p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 id="add-quote">7) Add a quote</h2>
            
            <h3 id="quote-objective">7.1) Functionality objective</h3>
            <p>The Add a quote functionality allows users to create a formal <strong>commercial proposal for a customer before any sale validation.</strong></p>
            <p>The quote has several objectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formalize a price offer,</strong></li>
                <li>Allow the customer to think or negotiate before purchase,</li>
                <li>Keep a written and numbered record of the proposal,</li>
                <li>Facilitate direct conversion of the quote to order after validation.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3 id="quote-interface-presentation">7.2) Interface presentation</h3>
            <p>The interface consists of 4 functional sections which are:</p>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ The General sale information section:</h4>
            <p>It groups the key administrative elements of a transaction, those that define the <strong>sale framework which are:</strong></p>
            
            <h5>1. Customer</h5>
            <p>This field allows linking the sale to an existing customer in the database, or adding a <strong>new customer if necessary.</strong> This enables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracking their purchase history,</li>
                <li>Generating personalized invoices,</li>
                <li>Managing specific commercial terms (discounts, deferred payment, etc.).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Why it's important:</strong> Without customer identification, it's impossible to manage credit, send personalized receipts, or retrieve the sale later.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Payment term (or payment deadline)</h5>
            <p>Optional field to define in how many days the payment should be made. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0 days (cash payment),</li>
                <li>15 days (Net 15),</li>
                <li>30 days (Net 30),</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This activates credit management and helps the system track customer receivables and reminders.</p>
            
            <h5>3. Sale date</h5>
            <p>This is the date when the transaction is recorded (or supposed to occur). By default, Movelys suggests the current date, but it can be modified for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A retroactive order,</li>
                <li>An administrative postponement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This date is used in accounting, sales reports, and fiscal reports.</p>
            
            <h5>4. Billing scheme</h5>
            <p>Term used to designate the <strong>automatic or manual invoice numbering model.</strong> A billing scheme can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard (for example: INV-2025-001),</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Customized (by customer or sale type),</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It allows organizing invoices in a uniform and traceable manner.</p>
            
            <h5>5. Invoice number</h5>
            <p>Unique number identifying the sale (or draft) in the system. It can be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automatically generated by the system following the scheme,</strong></li>
                <li>Or manually entered by the user (if authorized).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This number is crucial for archiving, legal invoicing, and accounting tracking.</p>
            
            <h5>6. Attach a document</h5>
            <p>Option to add an attached file to the sale. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer purchase order,</li>
                <li>Advance payment proof,</li>
                <li>Specific commercial terms,</li>
                <li>External invoice or signed quote.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Supported formats are typically: PDF, CSV, DOCX, PNG.</p>
            <p>Useful to justify a sale or attach any contractual document related to this transaction.</p>
            
            <h4>Summary: What is this section for?</h4>
            <p>The "General Information" section allows to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Precisely identify the sale and concerned customer,</li>
                <li>Define the legal and commercial framework of the transaction,</li>
                <li>Ensure data consistency across the entire Movelys system.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In this section you can add a product and also search for a product already present in the database to add it to the table</p>
            
            <h4>‚ùñ Sale parameters section</h4>
            <p>It groups fields used to adjust pricing conditions, apply discounts, manage taxation, and insert internal or customer notes about the sale.</p>
            
            <h5>1. Discount type</h5>
            <p>This field defines how the discount is applied to the sale. The most common types are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Percentage (%): proportional reduction (e.g. 10%)</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fixed amount: absolute value reduction (e.g. 5,000 FCFA)</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It determines how the discount will be calculated on the total amount or on each item.</p>
            
            <h5>2. Discount amount</h5>
            <p>This field specifies the amount or percentage of discount to apply according to the chosen type. Examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the type is %, entering "10" will apply a 10% reduction on the order.</li>
                <li>If the type is amount, entering "2000" will deduct 2000 FCFA from the gross total.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Allows offering customer benefits or applying commercial policies (sales, promotions, commercial gestures).</p>
            
            <h5>3. Order tax rate (sometimes called 'Order Tax' or 'Order VAT')</h5>
            <p>This is the tax rate applied to the entire order. It is defined:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Either automatically according to the country or default configuration (e.g. 18%),</li>
                <li>Or selected manually (if multiple rates are possible depending on products or customers).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This rate is used for automatic VAT calculation or any regulatory tax, and will be included in the invoice.</p>
            
            <h5>4. Sale note</h5>
            <p>Free text field to add textual information to the sale. Usage examples:</p>

                <li>Internal note for colleague follow-up.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This note may appear on the customer ticket, invoice, or remain internal depending on configuration.</p>
            
            <h4>Summary: Role of this section</h4>
            <p>The "Sale Parameters" section is essential to:</p>

                <li>Customize pricing conditions,</li>
                <li>Comply with tax regulations,</li>
                <li>Facilitate internal or customer communication.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>‚ùñ Shipping and logistics information section</h4>
            <p>It groups all elements necessary for order preparation, shipping, delivery, and <strong>physical tracking.</strong> It is activated as soon as a product needs to be physically delivered to the customer.</p>
            
            <h5>1. Shipping details</h5>
            <p>Global field used to:</p>

            </ul>

                <li>Entered manually (temporary or different address).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This address is mandatory if delivery is planned. It is used for documents, labels, and zone calculations.</p>
            
            <h5>3. Shipping fees</h5>
            <p>Amount to charge the customer to cover transport or shipping costs. This field can be:</p>

            <h5>5. Delivered to</h5>
            <p>Name of the person receiving the order at the delivery address. This field is useful if the recipient is not the initial customer (e.g.: assistant, receptionist, third-party company).</p>

            <h5>Button: Add additional expenses</h5>
            <p>This button allows recording <strong>expenses associated with the order but not billed to the customer.</strong> Expense examples:</p>

                <li>Purchase of shipping-related accessories.</li>

                <li>Manage a journal of logistics expenses per sale.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These expenses don't impact the customer total but enrich <strong>internal</strong> cost reports.</p>
            
            <h4>Role of this section</h4>
            <p>The logistics section enables complete management of the delivery chain, from address entry to post-delivery tracking. It is indispensable for any business performing <strong>physical deliveries, as it:</strong></p>

                <li>Be <strong>converted to order/invoice with one click (without re-entry).</strong></li>

            <h4>A. Template download</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can download a <strong>CSV or Excel template with the</strong> <strong>expected columns</strong> (reference, customer, date, products, quantities, amounts, payment status, etc.).</li>
                <li>This template is provided to standardize the format of data to be imported.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>B. File upload</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the template is completed, the user selects the file to import.</li>
                <li>The system verifies data validity: duplicates, incorrect format, missing fields, encoding errors (e.g.: wrong separator).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>C. Import preview</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Before final validation, users can preview <strong>detected sales.</strong></li>
                <li>Erroneous lines are highlighted with clear error messages for correction.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>D. Final import</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Once the file is validated, sales are integrated into the database, appear in the sales list, and trigger:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Stock movements,</li>
                        <li>Customer updates,</li>
                        <li>Report generation.</li>

                </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>E) Download</h4>
            <p>Once the import is complete, you can download the file and review it to verify all updates were properly applied.</p>
            <p>This interface also provides instructions to follow for successful imports.</p>
