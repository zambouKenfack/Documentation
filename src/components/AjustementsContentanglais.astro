        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Stock adjustment management is a critical function for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of inventory data within any company. In the <strong>Movelys</strong> application, this functionality has been designed to provide rigorous and transparent control over all manual or automatic modifications of stock quantities, whether due to inventory errors, losses, damages, or unrecorded movements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Movelys' "Stock Adjustment" module allows users to correct discrepancies between actual physical stock and system-recorded stock. Each adjustment can be classified by type (normal or abnormal), associated with a location, a <strong>responsible</strong> user, and justified by a specific reason. All operations are tracked, timestamped, and accessible via detailed history, ensuring <strong>complete traceability</strong> and <strong>compliance with management standards</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By offering a simple, fast interface interconnected with other modules (products, transfers, sales, etc.), Movelys helps prevent accounting errors, identify recurring discrepancies, and improve stock reconciliation processes. Companies thus gain better control of their resources, more informed decision-making, and enhanced logistical performance.
